.SYNOPSIS
    Runs all access control test scripts and reports results.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script executes both test files (access-control-test.js and simple-access-test.js)
    and reports the results in a clear, formatted way. It also checks for vulnerability scanner,
    bug monitoring, and integration between security and user management services.
